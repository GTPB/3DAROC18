## Course Description

3C-based methods, such as Hi-C, produce a huge amount of raw data as pairs of DNA reads that are spatially close in the cell nucleus. Overall, these interaction matrices have been used to study how the genome folds within the nucleus, that is one of the most fascinating problems in modern biology. The rigorous analysis of the paired-reads using computational tools has been essential to fully exploit the experimental technique, and to study how the genome is folded in the space. Currently, there is a huge expansion on the wealth of data on genome structure with the availability of many datasets of Hi-C experiments down to 1 kb resolution (see for example: http://hic.umassmed.edu/welcome/welcome.php; http://promoter.bx.psu.edu/hi-c/view.php or http://www.aidenlab.org/data.html). In this course, participants will learn to use TADbit, a software designed and developed to manage all the dimensionalities of the Hi-C data:
