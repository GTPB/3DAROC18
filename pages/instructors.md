**Marc A. Marti-Renom** obtained a Ph.D. in Biophysics from the Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona where he worked on protein folding under the supervision of B. Oliva, F.X. Aviles and M. Karplus. After that, he went to the US for a postdoctoral training on protein structure modeling at the Sali Lab (Rockefeller University) as the recipient of the Burroughs Wellcome Fund fellowship. Later on, Marc was appointed Assistant Adjunct Professor at UCSF. 

Between 2006 and 2011, he headed of the Structural Genomics Group at the CIPF in Valencia (Spain). Currently, Marc is an ICREA research professor and leads the Structural Genomics Group at the National Center for Genomic Analysis - Centre for Genomic Regulation (CNAG-CRG) in Barcelona. His group is broadly interested on how RNA, proteins and genomes organize and regulate cell fate. Finally, Marc is an Associate Editor of the PLoS Computational Biology journal and has published over 90 articles in international peer-reviewed journals.

## François Serra
**Affiliation:** Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico (CNAG) and Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona, ES

<img src="./images/instructors/François Serra.jpg" height="220px" width="170px" align="left" style="margin-right: 3%; margin-bottom: 0.3em;">

**François Serra** obtained his Degree in Biology, specialized in Physiology and Neurophysiology, his Master's Degree in Structural genomics and bioinformatics (Strasbourg I University, France) and it's PhD in Evolutionary Genomics in the Department of Bioinformatics at the CIPF (Valencia). He is now part of the Structural Genomic team of Marc Marti-Renom at CNAG and at CRG (Barcelona). 

His main research interests are grounded on comparative genomics and evolution with a special focus on the effect of evolution in the structural arrangement of genomes. He has taught MEPA and 3DMOG for GTPB, and also in similar courses at CIPF (Valencia, ES) and the Department of Genetics of the University of Cambridge (UK).

## David Castillo
**Affiliation:** Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico (CNAG) and Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona, ES

<img src="./images/instructors/David_Castillo.jpg" height="220px" width="170px" align="left" style="margin-right: 3%; margin-bottom: 0.3em;">

**David Castillo**  obtained his MSc in Photonics from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona (Spain) where he worked in Super-resolution microscopy. He has a background in Physics and Engineering. 

He works as a technician in the Structural Genomics team of Marc A. Martí-Renom at CNAG-CRG (Barcelona), developing tools for the analysis, modelling and visualization of HiC data. 

He is also interested in the integration of microscopy to the modeling of genomic 3D structures.
